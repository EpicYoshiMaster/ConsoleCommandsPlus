description="Your favorite Developer Console just got better![br][br][br]This mod greatly enhances the console's command library, providing access to various save file properties (ex. Pons, Yarn, Time Pieces), unlock commands, old locked commands from previous versions, useful shortcuts, and plenty more![br][br][br]Use Combo Commands to string multiple commands together into one convenient shortcut![br][br][br]Assign an Initialization Command to set things up right when you load into a level![br][br][br]For Speedrunners, enhanced support for functionality from Speedrun Tools is included. You can set various saved positions, reload cherry hover setups, time strats, and use various shortcuts to practice anything and everything.[br][br][br][br]A config option is also included to customize how the developer console handles cheats being enabled. Set this to Always Active to ensure the console is always enabled, While Open to only enable the console when you have it up (hotkeys will not work with this setting), or Manual if you want the default behavior.[br][br][br]Note: Death Wish checks if you have a cheat manager enabled and will not give stamps if this is the case! You'll want to make sure your config is set to either While Open or Manual to ensure your stamps count as completed![br][br][br]Now obviously a command library isn't much use if you don't know what you can do with it, so here's all the available commands offered in the Cheat Manager (Keep in mind this isn't a comprehensive list of all console commands).[br][br]https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gJZ-ZXKbUqXVIMNIg-4oMCRAcQHID0YzvUPeHisohZY/edit?usp=sharing[br][br]"
